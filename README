Monopoly

This is a project I started in 2013 to create a Monopoly engine. The goals for the project are as follows:

1. To simulate a game of Monopoly between at least two local players as accurately as possible.
2. To develop a basic GUI that shows the information that's relevant to each player.
3. To learn and use OOP best practices.
4. To allow the project to accomade future expansion, such as networked multiplayer, singleplayer, different game boards, etc.

The project is currently unfinished.
